### What is this?

This is a voltage clamp simulator. It replicates one of the most useful experimental techniques developed in the late 1940s to study excitable biological membranes. This technique was most famously used to construct the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which is fundamental to our understanding of action potential propagation in neurons. 

The purpose of a voltage clamp is to control the voltage across a cell membrane while simultaneously recording the movement of charged ions though different types of ion channels. Actual experiments require expensive equipment and trained personnel, but we can make use of simulations to give us a basic understanding of the technique and what can be gained from it.
